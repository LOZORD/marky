          <h3>About the Office</h3>
          <p>
            Dr. Rudberg is an out-of-network provider. Our office will submit claims to your insurance company as a courtesy. Patients
            are responsible for payment at the time of service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Rudberg has opted out of the Medicare program and neither our office nor our patients can submit claims to Medicare.
            This applies to the doctor's services only. If you are sent for testing at another facility depending on their
            policies, that should fall back under the Medicare program.

                  After his undergrad at UW-Milwaukee, Dr. Rudberg earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin,
                  where he was elected into AOA, a national honors society. Dr. Rudberg then completed his training in Internal
                  Medicine at Boston University Medical Center. Next, he completed a fellowship in Geriatrics and received
                  a Masters of Public Health, both at B.U.

                <h4>Research and Teaching</h4>
                <p>
                  After training, Dr. Rudberg became a full-time faculty member at the University of Chicago with the Section of General Internal
                  Medicine. There his patient care, in a variety of settings, focused on both Geriatrics and General Internal
                  Medicine of younger adults. He was an attendant on the General Internal Consultative Service and the General
                  Inpatient Units.

                  Biology and Human Nutrition, and the Medical Director of the teaching nursing home of the University of
                  Chicago. Dr. Rudberg's primary research interest is to develop ways to maintain independence for frail
                  older persons. He has published over 40 articles on dementia, falls, incontinence, delirium, nutrition,
                  and exercise. In 1987, he was promoted to a senior faculty member of the University of Chicago.
